abstract="In this paper authors propose a method of sleep analysis based on the algorithm of artificial neural networks. Unlike polysomnography methods, that are used commonly in clinical practice, the described method does not require specialist equipment or a qualified technician to analyze biomedical signals. The results presented in this work show that the properly implemented neural network algorithm can determine incidents during sleep and recognize its phases. Main idea was tested on the base of data collected from sleep laboratory of eight patients. From many signals collected during clinical assessment only two were taken under further consideration: heart rate and blood saturation. As it was shown, these two parameters measured during sleep allows to determine incidents occurring during sleeping and even to recognize actual stage of sleep. It means, that it is possible to use simple device that measures only heart rate and blood saturation to identify sleep apnea syndrome. The method is very effective and can replace the existing ways to recognizing sleep problems especially, when sleep examination of patient is conducted in home conditions.",

NUMBER = {9},

ABSTRACT = {Myocardial infarction is one of the most threatening cardiovascular diseases for human beings. With the rapid development of wearable devices and portable electrocardiogram (ECG) medical devices, it is possible and conceivable to detect and monitor myocardial infarction ECG signals in time. This paper proposed a multi-channel automatic classification algorithm combining a 16-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory network (LSTM) for I-lead myocardial infarction ECG. The algorithm preprocessed the raw data to first extract the heartbeat segments; then it was trained in the multi-channel CNN and LSTM to automatically learn the acquired features and complete the myocardial infarction ECG classification. We utilized the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) database for algorithm verification, and obtained an accuracy rate of 95.4%, a sensitivity of 98.2%, a specificity of 86.5%, and an F1 score of 96.8%, indicating that the model can achieve good classification performance without complex handcrafted features.},
